# Conv_Neur_Net_on_Image_Data

No prerequisites for this file. It is a technical paper written by myself and a classmate for RIT's Graduate Course in Software Engineering as part of the M.S. Data Science online. We explored the feasibility of using convolutional neural networks on medical imaging data to train a model in accurately identifying types of skin disease.
